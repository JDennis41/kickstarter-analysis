# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to provide Louise with information about how other theater campaigns managed in relation to their launch date and funding goals. The information provided will aid Louise in making appropriate decisions regarding her own play. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The months associated with <60% sucess rate of total outcomes are January, August, October, and December. Louise may consider avoiding these months when choosing a launch date. 
2. The summer months (May-August) have the longest consecutive trends for both successful and failed outcomes. This is probably related to the increase in campaigns launched during this time span.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Most campaigns seem to succeed when they have a goal of <$15,000 and between $35,000 and $44,999. They tend to fail whenn their goals are between $25,000 and       $34999, or >$45,000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - The results may be skewed because of missing data. For example, the data set includes data from 2009-2017, however, there are no results for failed or canceled     campaigns until 2014.
  - There is also missing data in regard to campaign launch dates. For example, 2010 only included data from July, October, and December, and in 2017, there is only     data from January and February. This could possibly be a seasonality trap. 
  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - A chart showing outcomes based on launch date in the US and Great Britian wouldd be more helpful for Louise since she is planing on campaigns in these two           countries. Also, a bar chart could be made to the percentage of successful total outcomes per month so that these figures would not have to be calculated.
